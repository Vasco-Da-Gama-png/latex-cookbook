# LaTeX Cookbook

This repo contains a [LaTeX document](cookbook.tex), usable as a cookbook (different "recipes" to achieve various things in LaTeX) as well as as a template.
The resulting PDF covers LaTeX-specific topics and instructions on compiling the LaTeX source.

It is available for download [**here**](https://github.com/alexpovel/latex-cookbook/releases/latest).
