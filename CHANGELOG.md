## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] - 2021-03-12

### Added

- Toggle for inclusion of glossaries in the Table of Contents (ToC) (5c23bd0)
- Example for an appendix (d4a42ce)
- Translations for code listings in references, lists, captions (6148d55)

- Configuration and ideal setup for working with this template inside Visual Studio Code, using its native container development environment (38a0bb2)
- Example for a new unit specification using `siunitx` (7a2d0d0)

### Changed

- Switched bibliography generation from vanilla Zotero to Zotero with its excellent **Better Bibtex** addon (a05f5f4)
- Fixed biblatex fields according to `biber --validate-datamodel` validation (eb068bd)
- Fixed using a system directory for `pandoc`, which required `sudo` privileges (no just user privileges) (d8f4c1c)

### Removed

- TeXGyrePagella font files: use those included in the TeX distribution itself (d74c2d9)
- Trailing whitespaces (WOW!) (d766fb6)

## [3.0.0] - 2021-02-03

### Added

- Option to suppress printing of pages list in the glossaries (b75d3d1)
- GitLab description templates (7038798)

### Changed

- Syntax highlighting now uses `minted` instead of `listings`, a backwards-incompatible change (19fbd87)
- Documentation now stresses Docker usage over manual "labour" (6843a2b)

### Removed

- Previous, custom-made `listings` language definitions; these are covered much better by `pygments`, aka `minted` (19fbd87)

## [2.0.0] - 2020-11-11

### Added

- Python-based tests for the produced PDFs (1746e4e).
  This allows the user to automatically run a test suite against the produced PDFs,
  for example checking for page count, metadata and much more.
- Makefiles for the [root](Makefile) and [tests](tests/Makefile) directories, while
  also swapping all CI routines over to use `make` (b4a9881).
  This allows for local as well as CI use using the same commands, and reduces coupling
  with the CI engine.
- Caching of files in CI, for much faster pipelines (while introducing some issues) (28aea76).
- Showcase and fixing of `\abs` macro for absolute values (4d0c6ff, bb11b72).

### Changed

- Git metadata display in the colophon (7c59cbe).

## [1.2.0] - 2020-10-29

### Added

- Showcase for multiple lines with contours in TikZ overlay (ae4ad39)
- Hint for the `glossaries-extra` *Beginner's Guide* (d8b7fb4)
- Written permission (license) to use and distribute the [Fontin Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fontin-sans)
  font (cf79ee4)
- Summary for font licenses (0372475)
- Contributing guideline (56c4eac)
- README info on git and Docker (fa228b7)
- A `matlab2tikz` exported plot example (86dac19, c3e9b09)
- `YAML`-based configs for pandoc (cb39706)
- Proper check for the used TeX engine (de2a293)

### Changed

- Fontawesome implementation, away from the `fontawesome` package to the more
  modern `fontawesome5` (8df784e)
- Insertion of git metadata into the document (PDF metadata or into the printed text
  directly): now based on Lua (6d0cd7e)
- Also adjusted the README according to the new Lua implementation (ed946b8)
