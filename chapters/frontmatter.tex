% Helper file that pulls subchapters together.
% Note that \subincludefrom{}{} cannot be nested

% Set initial pages to alpha, so that they do not collide with later Arabic numbering
% in the generated PDF. This won't show in print because page numbers aren't displayed
% until later. But you will be able to print the title page by printing page 'a', which
% would otherwise overlap with page '1', aka the first actual text page.
\pagenumbering{alph}
\maketitle
\subimport{frontmatter/}{colophon}

\frontmatter% In KOMAScript, resets pagenumber, uses Roman numerals etc.
\subimport{frontmatter/}{task}
\subimport{frontmatter/}{authorship_declaration}

% addchap is KOMA equivalent for \chapter*, but also creates ToC entry, see also

% Use built-in macro \glossaryname for proper internationalization.
% It will contain \text<language>, so fall back to English string for the PDF/hyperref
% output. It does not matter anyway since this is an unnumbered chapter.
\addchap{\texorpdfstring{\glossaryname}{Glossary}}%

% Print "unsorted" glossaries; these are in fact sorted, but externally using bib2gls.
% These will throw 'Token not allowed in PDF, removing \text<language>' warning.
% Specify title= manually if that gets too annoying.
