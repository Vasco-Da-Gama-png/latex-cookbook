% Helper file that pulls subchapters together.
% Note that \subincludefrom{}{} cannot be nested

% Set initial pages to alpha, so that they do not collide with later Arabic numbering
% in the generated PDF. This won't show in print because page numbers aren't displayed
% until later. But you will be able to print the title page by printing page 'a', which
% would otherwise overlap with page '1', aka the first actual text page.
\pagenumbering{alph}
\maketitle
\subimport{frontmatter/}{colophon}

\frontmatter% In KOMAScript, resets pagenumber, uses Roman numerals etc.
